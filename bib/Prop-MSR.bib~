	a semiautomatic fourstep approach for aspect mining is proposed based
	on dynamic analysis and association rules. In a preliminary evaluation
	in two systems, the proposed approach successfully discovered a number
	of crosscutting concerns (candidate aspects) already identified for
	these systems by existing approaches.}},
